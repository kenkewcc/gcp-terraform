1. Use Google Cloud Managed Prometheus for monitoring
  We Use node exporter to export all the node metrics. It can monitor the following
 - I/O usage
 - Network usage
 - CPU
 - Memory
 - Diskpace usage

  We can additional exporter for databases / nginx / apache/ to monitor those services.

We can configure HPA based on the pod metrics we collected.
Then, we can use cluster autoscaler to scale vertically based on node metrics. 
As for alerting, we can use alertmanager to fire the alert to user when certain threshold breach.

2. Use Cloud Monitoring for monitoring 
  We can use the kubernetes metrics that are collected when we enable system metrics in GKE.
  We can configure alert for load balancer sudden spike or when 4xx/5xx too high

3. We can use tool like opentracing, istio, newrelic or similar tool to trail the request.
 - Monitor the latency when it pass through certain point. 
 - Monitor application/network performance.
